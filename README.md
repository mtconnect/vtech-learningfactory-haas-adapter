# An MTConnect Use Case Study at Virginia Tech Learning Factory

While digitization and data sciences can be overbearing, creating a prototype cell is a fast and easy way to understand these new technologies. In this project at the Virginia Tech Learning factory, a group of undergraduates implemented MTConnect on a Haas three-axis mill.
